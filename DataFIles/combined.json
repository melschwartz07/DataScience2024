The text is divided into two parts. Each part supports a one-semester module, the first part addressing fundamental programming concepts, and the second part building on this foundation, teaching the skills required to develop more advanced applications. This fully updated and greatly enhanced fourth edition covers the key developments introduced in Java 8, including material on JavaFX, lambda expressions and the Stream API. Topics and features: begins by introducing fundamental programming concepts such as declaration of variables, control structures, methods and arrays; goes on to cover the fundamental object-oriented concepts of classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism; uses JavaFX throughout for constructing event-driven graphical interfaces; includes advanced topics such as interfaces and lambda expressions, generics, collection classes and exceptions; explains file-handling techniques, packages, multi-threaded programs, socket programming, remote database access and processing collections using streams; includes self-test questions and programming exercises at the end of each chapter, as well as two illuminating case studies; provides additional resources at its associated website (simply go to springer.com and search for \"Java in Two Semesters\"), including a guide on how to install and use the NetBeansTM Java IDE. Offering a gentle introduction to the field, assuming no prior knowledge of the subject, Java in Two Semesters is the ideal companion to undergraduate modules in software development or programming.",

It uses Java 6 and includes detailed explanations of key concepts, solved examples, and a number of supplements for students and instructors found on an accompanying CD and a dedicated website. The book also includes a detailed chapter on Graphical User Interface, which allows students to begin to produce programs that they can interact with in more familiar ways.",

                    "description": "Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.",

Java RTS and the RTSJ standard (JSR-001) eliminate the need for complicated, specialized, real-time languages and operating environments, saving money by leveraging Java's exceptional productivity and familiarity. In Real-Time Java(tm) Programming, two of Sun's top real-time programming experts present the deep knowledge and realistic code examples that developers need to succeed with Java RTS and its APIs. As they do so, the authors also illuminate the foundations of real-time programming in any RTSJ-compatible environment. Key topics include Real-time principles and concepts, and the unique requirements of real-time application design and development How Java has been adapted to real-time environments A complete chapter on garbage collection concepts and Java SE collectors Using the Java RTS APIs to solve actual real-time system problems as efficiently as possible Utilizing today's leading Java RTS development and debugging tools Understanding real-time garbage collection, threads, scheduling, and dispatching Programming new RTSJ memory models Dealing with asynchronous event handling and asynchronous transfer of control",

Two-dimensional subjects discussed include logical coordinates, triangulation of polygons and both Bezier and B-spline curve fitting. There is also a chapter about transformations, culminating in a useful Java class for 3D rotations about an arbitrary axis. The perspective representation of 3D solid objects is discussed in detail, including efficient algorithms for hidden-face and hidden-line elimination. These and many other algorithms are accompanied by complete, ready-to-run Java programs which can be downloaded from the accompanying web site.",

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\"--Martin BuchholzJDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems\"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and tomorrow's--systems.\"--Doron RajwanResearch Scientist, Intel Corp\"This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.\"--Ted NewardAuthor of Effective Enterprise Java\"Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\"--Kirk PepperdineCTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com\"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day.

In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You'll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with. If you write Java programs to run against an Oracle database, this book is a must-have.",

Look no further! Effective Java\u2122, Second Edition, brings together seventy-eight indispensable programmer\u2019s rules of thumb: working, best-practice solutions for the programming challenges you encounter every day. This highly anticipated new edition of the classic, Jolt Award-winning work has been thoroughly updated to cover Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 features introduced since the first edition. Bloch explores new design patterns and language idioms, showing you how to make the most of features ranging from generics to enums, annotations to autoboxing. Each chapter in the book consists of several \u201citems\u201d presented in the form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and outstanding code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why. Highlights include: New coverage of generics, enums, annotations, autoboxing, the for-each loop, varargs, concurrency utilities, and much more Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, libraries, methods, and serialization How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.util.concurrent and java.io Simply put, Effective Java\u2122, Second Edition, presents the most practical, authoritative guidelines available for writing efficient, well-designed programs.",

This book is designed to save you time and frustration by carefully guiding you through this potential minefield. A team of Java experts, led by programming guru Michael Daconta, offers a collection of proven solutions to 50 difficult, real-world problems chosen from their own extensive experiences. You'll find workarounds for problems caused by shortcomings in both the Java language itself and in its APIs and utilities, including java.util, java.io, java.awt, and javax.swing. The authors also share techniques for improving the performance of your Java applications. For easy reference, the book is organized into categories so that similar solutions are grouped together. Examples of topics covered include: * Language syntax, for example, using the String equals( ) method instead of the == operator (Item2) * Language support, for example, method dispatching with reflection, interfaces, and anonymous classes (Item 16) * Utilities and collections, like choosing between a PropertyFile and ResourceBundle (Item 20) * Input/output, including subtleties in sending serialized objects over a network (Item 25) * GUI presentation, for example, tackling the common pitfall of using repaint( ) instead of validate( ) for relaying out components (Item 29) * Performance, including tips like lazy loading your way to better performance (Item 43)",

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception.Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.Style and approachThroughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.",

It discusses the methods for solving different types of mathematical problems using MATLAB and Python. Although the book focuses on the approximation problem rather than on error analysis of mathematical problems, it provides practical ways to calculate errors. The book is divided into three parts, covering topics in numerical linear algebra, methods of interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, solutions of differential equations, linear and non-linear programming problems, and optimal control problems. This book has the following advantages: It adopts the programming languages, MATLAB and Python, which are widely used among academics, scientists, and engineers, for ease of use and contain many libraries covering many scientific and engineering fields. It contains topics that are rarely found in other numerical analysis books, such as ill-conditioned linear systems and methods of regularization to stabilize their solutions, nonstandard finite differences methods for solutions of ordinary differential equations, and the computations of the optimal controls. It provides a practical explanation of how to apply these topics using MATLAB and Python. It discusses software libraries to solve mathematical problems, such as software Gekko, pulp, and pyomo. These libraries use Python for solutions to differential equations and static and dynamic optimization problems. Most programs in the book can be applied in versions prior to MATLAB 2017b and Python 3.7.4 without the need to modify these programs. This book is aimed at newcomers and middle-level students, as well as members of the scientific community who are interested in solving math problems using MATLAB or Python.",

Many examples are taken from real-world projects. The book focuses on high-level design as well as the gritty details of the Python syntax. The provided exercises inspire the reader to think about his or her own code, rather than providing solved problems. If you're new to Object Oriented Programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn in depth how and when to correctly apply Object Oriented Programming in Python, this is the book for you. If you are an object-oriented programmer for other languages, you too will find this book a useful introduction to Python, as it uses terminology you are already familiar with. Python 2 programmers seeking a leg up in the new world of Python 3 will also find the book beneficial, and you need not necessarily know Python 2.",

It provides a close examination of physical environments of soil, including an analysis of the movement of heat, water and gases. The authors employ the programming language Python, which is now widely used for numerical problem solving in the sciences. In contrast to the majority of the literature on soil physics, this text focuses on solving, not deriving, differential equations for transport. Using numerical procedures to solve differential equations allows the solution of quite difficult problems with fairly simple mathematical tools. Numerical methods convert differential into algebraic equations, which can be solved using conventional methods of linear algebra. Each chapter introduces a soil physics concept, and proceeds to develop computer programs to solve the equations and illustrate the points made in the discussion. Problems at the end of each chapter help the reader practise using the concepts introduced. The text is suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers of soil physics. It employs an open source philosophy where computer code is presented, explained and discussed, and provides the reader with a full understanding of the solutions. Once mastered, the code can be adapted and expanded for the user's own models, fostering further developments. The Python tools provide a simple syntax, Object Oriented Programming techniques, powerful mathematical and numerical tools, and a user friendly environment.",

Paired with the most efficient scripting language-Python, we can write effective scripts that extend the core functionality of QGIS.Based on the latest version QGIS 2.18, this book will teach you how to write Python code that works with spatial data to automate geoprocessing tasks in QGIS. It will cover topics such as querying and editing vector data and using raster data. You will also learn to create, edit, and optimize a vector layer for faster queries, reproject a vector layer, reduce the number of vertices in a vector layer without losing critical data, and convert a raster to a vector. Following this, you will work through recipes that will help you compose static maps, create heavily customized maps, and add specialized labels and annotations. As well as this, we'll also share a few tips and tricks based on different aspects of QGIS.",

Network analysis is a powerful tool you can apply to a multitude of datasets and situations. Discover how to work with all kinds of networks, including social, product, temporal, spatial, and semantic networks. Convert almost any real-world data into a complex network--such as recommendations on co-using cosmetic products, muddy hedge fund connections, and online friendships. Analyze and visualize the network, and make business decisions based on your analysis. If you're a curious Python programmer, a data scientist, or a CNA specialist interested in mechanizing mundane tasks, you'll increase your productivity exponentially. Complex network analysis used to be done by hand or with non-programmable network analysis tools, but not anymore! You can now automate and program these tasks in Python. Complex networks are collections of connected items, words, concepts, or people. By exploring their structure and individual elements, we can learn about their meaning, evolution, and resilience. Starting with simple networks, convert real-life and synthetic network graphs into networkx data structures. Look at more sophisticated networks and learn more powerful machinery to handle centrality calculation, blockmodeling, and clique and community detection. Get familiar with presentation-quality network visualization tools, both programmable and interactive--such as Gephi, a CNA explorer. Adapt the patterns from the case studies to your problems. Explore big networks with NetworKit, a high-performance networkx substitute. Each part in the book gives you an overview of a class of networks, includes a practical study of networkx functions and techniques, and concludes with case studies from various fields, including social networking, anthropology, marketing, and sports analytics. Combine your CNA and Python programming skills to become a better network analyst, a more accomplished data scientist, and a more versatile programmer. What You Need: You will need a Python 3.x installation with the following additional modules: Pandas (>=0.18), NumPy (>=1.10), matplotlib (>=1.5), networkx (>=1.11), python-louvain (>=0.5), NetworKit (>=3.6), and generalizesimilarity. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution that comes with all these modules, except for python-louvain, NetworKit, and generalizedsimilarity, and works on all major modern operating systems.",

It develops statistical methods for the analysis of optical/infrared and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, including wavelet transformations, kernel methods for nonlinear classification, as well as an introduction to deep learning in the context of feed forward neural networks. The material is self-contained and illustrated with many programming examples, all of which can be conveniently run in a web browser. Each chapter concludes with exercises complementing or extending the material in the text. Numerous examples of programming the Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow APIs are given. New in the fourth edition is an in-depth treatment of a recent sequential change detection algorithm for polarimetric SAR image time series. The accompanying software consists of Python (open source) versions of all of the main image analysis algorithms, thus accessible to all readers with a computer and an Internet connection. Features Includes open source software and tools Presents easy, platform-independent software installation methods (Docker containerization) Concepts and algorithms are illustrated in Jupyter notebooks Utilizes freely accessible imagery via the Google Earth Engine Examines deep learning examples including a sound introduction to neural networks Provides many examples of cloud programming (Google Earth Engine API) SAR image time series.
