    "<em>Lab 7 consists of two exercises on relational and document-oriented databases.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a program that will map New York City restaurants on a map using Folium and Choropleth with sample data on [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com). We will use the ```restaurants``` collection in the database ```sample_restaurants``` that comes with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query the ```restaurants``` collection to find documents where the cuisine is ```Irish``` and its last grade was an ```A```. The returned documents will include location information (i.e., the name of the restaurants, address, coordinates, etc.). You may need to put this data into a ```DataFrame```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a ```DataFrame``` with a count of restaurants that met the conditions above by borough. A borough is like a neighborhood in New York City. There are five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. The data will only refer to the Bronx as Bronx (without the *the*).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a map using Folium that centers and zooms in on New York City. The coordinates are (40.7128, -74.0060). All boroughs should be visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a marker for every restaurant that met the conditions. The returned document will have the coordinates for each restaurant. However, the coordinates are reversed in order in the JSON! The JSON has the longitude first and then the latitude. The rest of the program expects latitude to come first. The marker will contain the name of the restaurant the street address. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Download the GeoJSON file for the NYC boroughs from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm). Include this file in the same directory as this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using choropleth and the GeoJSON file, shade the boroughs based on the count of restaurants that met the conditions above. The ```key_on``` keyword argument is ```feature.properties.boro_name```, which contains the name of the borough and will match up with your counts ```DataFrame``` from step 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Save the map in a file named ```map.html```."
